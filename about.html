        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The building that is now The Irish Inn at Glen Echo has long been a gathering place.
          Over the decades it has served as a family home, a biker bar, and a roadside inn
          before becoming the restaurant and pub our guests know today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2003, the space was reimagined as an Irish inn—pairing the warmth of a traditional
          pub with a menu that celebrates both Irish classics and contemporary American cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we continue to honor that history while evolving our food, drink, and hospitality
          to welcome new generations of guests.

        <h2>At the Heart of Glen Echo</h2>
        <p>
          Steps away from Glen Echo Park and the Potomac River, the Inn has become a favorite stop
          for neighbors, hikers, artists, and visitors exploring the C&amp;O Canal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you join us for a pint after a walk, Sunday brunch with family, or an evening of
          live music, our goal is to make every visit feel like coming home.
